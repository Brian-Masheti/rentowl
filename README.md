# RentOwl ‚Äì Rental Property Management System

RentOwl is a modern, full-stack rental property management platform for landlords, caretakers, and tenants. It streamlines property, finance, and communication workflows in one place.

## üöß Project Status

**This project is under active development.**

- The backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) is fully functional and tested with Postman.
- The frontend (React/JSX/Vite) has been fully migrated from TypeScript to JavaScript/JSX for easier maintenance and fewer build errors. All code is DRY, modular, and error-free.
- Registration now redirects users directly to the login page after successful signup (not the landing page).

## üåü Highlighted Features

### Caretaker Actions (Landlord Dashboard)
- Real-time caretaker activity log with instant updates via Socket.io
- Filter actions by caretaker, property, type, status, date, and description
- View full action details in a modal
- Export filtered actions as CSV
- See summary stats for quick insights
- Automated logging for maintenance resolutions and other key events
- Rate limiting for API protection
- Clean UI: section title shown only in nav, not repeated in content
- Only regular users (landlord, tenant, caretaker) can log in at `/login`
- Fully documented API (see Swagger docs at `/api/docs`)

### Super Admin & Admin Management (RBAC)
- Secure, dedicated super admin login at `/admin/login` (not public login)
- Super admin dashboard for managing all admins and support users

- Admin/support users cannot log in at `/login` (permission denied)

#### Real-Time & Environment Setup
- The dashboard uses Socket.io for real-time updates.
- Configure your `.env` files:
  - `VITE_API_URL` for local backend (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
  - `VITE_API_URL_NETWORK` for LAN backend (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:5000)
- The frontend will automatically use the correct backend based on these variables.
