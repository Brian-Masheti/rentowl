# RentOwl Privacy & Data Access Policy

## 1. Data Ownership & Privacy

- All data entered into RentOwl by landlords, caretakers, or tenants—including property details, tenant information, financial records, maintenance requests, and documents—remains the exclusive property of the landlord (the client).
- RentOwl does not claim ownership of your business data and will not use it for any purpose other than providing and supporting the RentOwl service.

## 2. Data Access Controls

- Each landlord’s data is logically separated and only accessible to users authorized by that landlord (e.g., their caretakers, tenants).
- Landlords have exclusive access to their financial dashboards, tenant lists, property records, and maintenance requests.
- Other landlords and clients cannot view or access your data.

## 3. Super Admin Access

- The RentOwl super admin (system administrator) has technical access to all data in the system for the sole purposes of:
  - Providing technical support and troubleshooting
  - Restoring accidentally deleted data (e.g., tenants, properties)
  - Ensuring system security, integrity, and compliance with legal requirements
- Super admin access to client data is strictly limited to these support and compliance scenarios and is not used for monitoring, competitive analysis, or any business purpose.
- All super admin access to client data is logged and auditable.

## 4. Data Security

- All data is stored securely in industry-standard cloud infrastructure (MongoDB Atlas).
- Access to production data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Regular backups are performed to ensure data can be restored in case of accidental loss.

## 5. Client Rights

- You may request a copy of your data or request deletion of your account at any time, subject to legal and contractual obligations.
- You may request an audit of super admin access to your data.

## 6. Transparency

- RentOwl is committed to transparency. If super admin access to your data is required for support, you will be notified upon request.
- Any changes to this policy will be communicated to all clients in advance.
